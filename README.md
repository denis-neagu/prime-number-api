### Prime Number API
Calculate prime numbers up to and including a limit using diverse algorithms. 
Choose your response layout and calculation strategy using query parameters.
### Project Set-up
**Note**: We'll need [JDK 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-0-13-later-archive-downloads.html)
and [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) installed.
```text
1. git clone https://github.com/denis-neagu/prime-number-api
2. cd primenumberapi
3. mvn clean install
4. mvn spring-boot:run
```
### Tech Stack
- **Java Version**: 17
- **Framework**: Spring Boot
- **Testing**: JUnit, Mockito, REST-Assured
- **Build & Dependency Management**: Maven
- **Annotation Processing and Productivity**: Lombok
- **Serialisation/Deserialisation**: Jackson
- **Deployment**: AWS, EC2, Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
- **Continuous Integration**: GitHub Workflows 
### Deployment
**Note:** No-configuration, easy-deployment platforms such as Heroku or Render provide HTTP(S) out the box. AWS EC2 does not enable HTTP(S) out of the box. 
To enable it we could use a reverse proxy like Nginx in the EC2 instance, but we'd need a certificate from a Certificate Authority (CA).
We could use a self-signed certificate, but we'd still receive a warning message. 
Alternatively we could also use a modern Load Balancer such as AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) and use AWS' Certificate Manager (ACM).<br>

**Note:** I have mapped the app to port 8080 in the EC2 instance, and you need to explicitly define the port in the URL before making a request. 
Otherwise, by default HTTP uses port 80, so it won't be making the request to the correct resource.

**Note:** The EC2 instance only provides 1GB of RAM and 1vCPU, therefore the number of primes we can calculate is limited to a small number around 100 million. 
We could use more vertical scaling using more RAM and CPU Cores to support higher calculations.

### Observations
1. JSON is more memory-efficient than XML, allowing more prime numbers to be displayed.
   Using cURL further increases this limit because it streams data in chunks to standard output, avoiding the browserâ€™s
   memory constraints and enabling serialization of much larger datasets.  
   <br>
2. Using Bitset significantly saves us memory consumption, but have to be managed carefully when used
   concurrently because it's not thread-safe.  
   <br>
3. Caching strategy immensely speeds up performance. Mixing caching with cache merges is also a
   great tool for speeding up performance on calculations that aren't yet cached. However, this has to be safely managed
   by setting a cache threshold relative to the total available memory to avoid memory consumptions growing indefinitely which would
   crash our application and be an inefficient way to implement caching. In addition to a threshold, I've implemented a cache reset, so when the threshold is reached we clear our cache to ensure
   a risk-free environment and running out of memory.  
   <br>
4. The best algorithm for the job depends on multiple constraints such as: input size, available threads, and memory.
   For example, a Concurrent Segmented Sieve is highly-performant for large input sizes, but uses a lot of memory due Multithreading
   and for small input sizes it's slower than a naive algorithm. Moreover, a BitSet Segmented Sieve is slower than a Concurrent Segmented Sieve,
   but it's more memory efficient so we can calculate more prime numbers, but at a slower pace. Furthermore, a naive algorithm can be
   great for small input sizes, but inefficient and not scalable for huge inputs.
